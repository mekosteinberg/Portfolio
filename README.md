# Portfolio for Meko
Step 1: Tuesday 7am-2pmPST + evening/night work time;
    I've started out creating a base skeleton in my html, to get a feel for what I need to have laid out. I know I can (and should) use JQ to create some of these HTML elements, and I will probably amend that later, but Im very visual and need to see it first, even a bad visual helps my brain create a mental map of what needs to be done. Next step will be some styling and flexbox, then onto the JS/JQ.
