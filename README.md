# Portfolio for Meko
Day 1: Tuesday 7am-2pmPST + evening/night work time;
    I've started out creating a base skeleton in my html, to get a feel for what I need to have laid out. I know I can (and should) use JQ to create some of these HTML elements, and I will probably amend that later, but Im very visual and need to see it first, even a bad visual helps my brain create a mental map of what needs to be done. Next step will be some styling and flexbox, then onto the JS/JQ. 
Day 2: Part 1: Wednesday 6-2pm Stuggled to get a fade/expand feature working
     most the day, modified to a little different idea with Toggle Class than the original I sought out. Finally got one working, realized I should commit. Next step, get each main div working with the toggle, and then focus on modals for each resume in the Work Experience section.
    Part 2: Wednesday evening. I realized I hadn't created multiple pages, just 
        included everything within the scope of one page. SO that freaked me out and set me back. Created more pages to accomplish my tasks and set to work. Youtube more modal videos as recommended by mentors. 

Day 3:
