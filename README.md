# Portfolio for Meko
Day 1: Tuesday 7am-2pmPST + evening/night work time;
    I've started out creating a base skeleton in my html, to get a feel for what I need to have laid out. I know I can (and should) use JQ to create some of these HTML elements, and I will probably amend that later, but Im very visual and need to see it first, even a bad visual helps my brain create a mental map of what needs to be done. Next step will be some styling and flexbox, then onto the JS/JQ. 
Day 2: Part 1: Wednesday 6-2pm Stuggled to get a fade/expand feature working most the day, modified to a little different idea with Toggle Class than the original I sought out. Finally got one working, realized I should commit. Next step, get each main div working with the toggle, and then focus on modals for each resume in the Work Experience section.
    Part 2: Wednesday evening. I realized I hadn't created multiple pages, just included everything within the scope of one page. SO that freaked me out and set me back. Created more pages to accomplish my tasks and set to work. Youtube more modal videos as recommended by mentors. 

Day 3: Got the Jquery for the carousel and modal buttons working... after 
    working all day on it! Now to plug it into the other spots needed. Lots of frustration and searching for answers. Power went out and unable to do more tonight.

Day 4: Part 1: Power is still out, but charged the laptop. Tried working on my 13" screen and almost chucked it across the room! Instead, we hooked up a generator and ran the cord into the office so I could work on my big screen. Just using lots of blankets! Still putting in data now that the buttons work. I may have overshot my photos for the carousel, but its just a lot of data entry, not difficult. Still need styling done and to make sure the sight is working on mobile devices how I think it is. 
    Part 2: Got all my photos in the carousel, added work exp details and some scroll feature on the modal. Trying to understand FlexBox order and how to use that for my media section and the pics.

Day 5: Today has been a struggle to get dropdowns working and style
    appropriately for responsive design. I know what I would do differently, next time I'd start building the mobile/phone version and then style for larger, instead of the starting with web. I only now discovered in the dev tools that you can switch TYPES of mobile devices, or make custom sized ones. I know, I know... duh. Styling Styling Styling right now, still need to host it
        Part2: If I dont stop soon I'm going to break something and have to spend the rest of the night fixing it. I think mobile is pretty much set. I got it deployed to Netlify.
